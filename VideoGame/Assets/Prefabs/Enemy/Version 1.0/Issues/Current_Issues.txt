- All collisions physically affect objects involed, knocking them widly. The only thing that should be affected by collisions (for now) is health. 
- Diagonal directions to normal directions for the player have quite a delay (about 1/3 of a second). 
- When enemies stack on top of each other, one projectile hits all of them at once. Normal projectiles should only hit one enemy at a time
- The player and enemies can sometimes (quite rarely but happens) get stuck to the ground and unable to move. Most likely at error in how their rigidbodies are set up, but not sure
